===================
Compiling and Running
===================
	Compiling all
		To compile the project, first, create a build directory and change to that directory:

			mkdir build && cd build

		From within the build directory, then run cmake and make as follows:

			cmake ..
			make
	Running
		The executables will be placed in the bin directory. From within build, you can run the project as follows:

			../bin/<name-of-parent-directory> -f ../map.osm


			=> jerry:build$    ../bin/CppND-Route-Planning-Project-master -f ../map.osm


===================
Testing
===================
	For exercises that have unit tests, the project must be built with the approprate test cpp file. This can be done by passing a string with the -DTESTING flag in cmake. For example, from the build directory:

		cmake -DTESTING="RouteModel" ..
		make

	Those commands will build the code with the tests for the "Fill Out Route Model" exercise. The tests can then be run from the build directory as follows:

		../bin/test

ex:



jerry:build$ cmake -DTESTING="RouteModel" ..
jerry:build$ make
jerry:build$ ../bin/test
[==========] Running 1 test from 1 test case.
[----------] Global test environment set-up.
[----------] 1 test from RouteModelTest
[ RUN      ] RouteModelTest.RouteModelData
[       OK ] RouteModelTest.RouteModelData (67 ms)
[----------] 1 test from RouteModelTest (67 ms total)

[----------] Global test environment tear-down
[==========] 1 test from 1 test case ran. (67 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 1 test.





Exercises with tests will specify which string to pass with -DTESTING, but a table is given below with the complete list for reference:

Exercise Name			-DTESTING String Value
Fill Out Route Model		"RouteModel"
Fill Out Node Class		"RMNodeClass"
Create RouteModel Nodes		"RMSNodes"
Write the Distance Function	"NodeDist"
Create Road to Node Hashmap	"NodeToRoad"
Write FindNeighbors		"FindNeighbors"
Find the Closest Node		"FindClosest"
Write the A* Search Stub	"AStarStub"
Finish A* Search		"AStarSearch"
